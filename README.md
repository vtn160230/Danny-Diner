## Business Task

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Case Study Questions
  
- What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
- How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
- What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
- What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
- Which item was the most popular for each customer?
- Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
- Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
- What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
- If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
- In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?


## Solution 
### Q1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
<details>

````sql
SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(price) AS total_amount_spent FROM sales s
JOIN menu ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
````

- I used the SUM and GROUP BY to figure out the total_amount_spent that each customer spent
- Used a JOIN to combine the sales and menu table on product_id that are from both tables
- Ended with an ORDER BY on customer_id to get an ascending table

### Q2: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
<details>

````sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) as days_visited FROM sales s
GROUP BY customer_id
````
<br>

- I used COUNT on the order_date to get each entry for the order_date, and DISTINCT to remove the duplicates of the same dates
- Finished with GROUP BY to get the customers in ascending order

### Q3: What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
<details>

````sql
  with t1 as(
	SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_name, 
	ROW_Number() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
	ORDER BY s.order_date) as rank
	FROM sales s
	JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name FROM t1
WHERE rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name
````
  
- Use t1 as a temporary table and use ROW_Number to create column ranks that is partitioned by the customer_id and ORDERED BY order_date
- Write new query pulling the customer_id and product_name from t1 table WHERE the rank = 1, which will pull the rank 1 entry for each customer_id
- GROUP BY customer_id and product_name to fetch the customer_id and first item ever ordered by the customer

### Q4: What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
<details>

````sql
SELECT product_name, COUNT(s.product_id) AS most_purchased FROM sales s
JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY product_name, s.product_id
ORDER BY most_purchased DESC
````

- Use COUNT of product_id to gather similar entries of the orders together
- GROUP BY the product_id and product_name to show all the products and the amount of times they were each purchased
- ORDER BY most_purchased DESC to get the highest to lowest
